```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Our first markdown for EEB workshop.

<!-- eval means the code doesn't display -->
```{r echo = FALSE}
# echo means the code doesn't display
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length,
     y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width",
     main = "Iris measurements")
```
